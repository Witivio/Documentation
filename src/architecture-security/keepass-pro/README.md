## Microsoft Teams Apps Security and Compliance

Microsoft works with our Microsoft 365 developer partners to provide the information organizations need to expedite and inform decisions about Microsoft Teams Apps and add-ins they use. The information is supplemented with information from the Microsoft Cloud App Security app catalog and information provided by the developers when they submit their applications. This security, data handling, and compliance information is intended to help organizations assess and manage risk in using these apps.
