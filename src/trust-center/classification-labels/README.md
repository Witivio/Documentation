# Classification Labels

To get their work done, people at Witivio collaborate with others both inside and outside the organization. This means that content roams everywhere, and when it roams, we want it to do so in a secure, protected way that meets our organization’s business and compliance policies.  

Here is the list of classification labels we're using, from the least to the most sensitive:

| Level | Label | Emoji | Description & Examples |

| 3 | **`INTERNAL`** | 🔐 | [#internal](#internal) |
