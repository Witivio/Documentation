# Infrastructure Services

Witivio relies on several "first-party" components and services such as the Microsoft Teams platform and Microsoft Azure.  
In addition the Witivio platform uses several "second-party" or "third-party" services, especially:
- Microsoft Azure Devops is our source code repository platform and issue tracking tool. [Learn more...](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-usr/services/devops/)
- As Witivio is not in the business of storing or processing payments, all payments made to Witivio goes through our partner, Chargebee. [Learn more...](https://chargebee.com/)

## Microsoft Teams

Witivio relies on the [Microsoft Teams extensibility platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/) to automate governance, bring business solutions and integrate LoB and CRM apps seamlessly into Microsoft Teams.  
Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that integrates with the apps and services that people use to get work done together.  

Especially, Witivio leverages the following Microsoft Teams extensibility components:

| Service | Role |

## Microsoft Azure DevOps

| Security Measures | Description |
|:-----------------:|-------------|
| HTTPS | All data received from and sent to GitHub is encrypted in transit. |
| Verified Domains | You can verify the domains controlled by your organization to confirm your organization's identity on GitHub. Organization owners are be able to verify the identity of organization members by viewing each member's email address within the verified domain. |
| 2FA | Access to our private repository requires two-factor authentication for everyone in the Witivio organization. [Learn more...](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication) |
| Protected Branches | Protected branches ensure that collaborators on our repositories cannot make irrevocable changes to branches. Enabling protected branches also allows us to enable other optional checks and requirements, like required status and security checks and required reviews. Moreover, deployment to production environments requires at leats two human validation steps. [Learn more...](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) |
| Security Alerts | GitHub automatically tracks public vulnerabilities in packages from supported languages on MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) List, and use a combination of machine learning and human review to detect vulnerabilities that are not published in the CVE list. |
