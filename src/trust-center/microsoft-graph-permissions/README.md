# Microsoft Graph Permissions

## Admin-restricted permissions
Depending on the permission type (Delegated or Application), some high-privilege permissions in the Microsoft ecosystem are set to admin-restricted.  
Examples of these kinds of permissions include the following:
* Read all user's full profiles by using ```User.Read.All```
* Write data to an organization's directory by using ```Directory.ReadWrite.All```
* Read all groups in an organization's directory by using ```Groups.Read.All```

For TeamsPro to access data in Microsoft Graph, your administrator must grant it the correct permissions via a consent process.
