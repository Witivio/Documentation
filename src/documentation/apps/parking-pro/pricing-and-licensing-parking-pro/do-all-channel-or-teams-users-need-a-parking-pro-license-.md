# Do all channel or Teams users need a Parking Pro license?

<p class="no-margin">You should purchase a license for each team member who wants to use the Premium features. </p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">For example, for Parking Pro, those team members who do not have a license allocated will only see up to 3 parking places, will only be able to create single reservations, won't be able to use tags or geolocation. </p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Premium users will have access to all premium features. </p>
