For example, it's not possible to allow some users to add events but not delete them, or to assign different permission levels to different users. <br><br>If you'd like to see this kind of detailed control over permissions in the future, <b>we encourage you to suggest it on <a href="https://ideas.teams-pro.com/" target="_blank" class="intercom-content-link">ideas.teams-pro.com</a></b></p>
