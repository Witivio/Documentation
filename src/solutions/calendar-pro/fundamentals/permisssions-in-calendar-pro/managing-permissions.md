### Can I assign multiple owners?

Yes, <b>you can assign multiple owners</b> in Calendar Pro. To grant a member Owner rights, click the dropdown button next to their role ('Member') and select <b>'Owner'</b>. 

**Important considerations:**
- This change is **non-reversible**. Once a member is assigned as an Owner, their role cannot be downgraded back to Member.
- The member **must have a Platinum license** assigned to be eligible for the Owner role.
