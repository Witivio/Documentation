# How to Manage Tags in Calendar Pro

Using tags to filter your events is a powerful way to personalize and streamline your Calendar Pro view. This feature allows you to categorize your events based on different criteria such as project, team, or task type. By adding tags, you can quickly and efficiently find the events that are most relevant to you, cutting through the clutter and enhancing your productivity. For example, using tags to filter events such as your colleagues' holidays is a great way to keep track of who's in and out of the office.


## Adding Tags Directly from the Event Creation Page

You can also add tags directly while creating a new event. This makes it easy to categorize your events on the go. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the **New Event** page.
2. In the **Tags** section under **Advanced**, type in the tag you want to add and click **Add**.

2. In the **Tag** dropdown at the top, start typing the tag you want to filter by and select it.

### Example Use Case: HR Team

HR Team uses Calendar Pro to manage employees' Paid Time Off (PTO) across multiple office locations. They created a **tag for each employee** so managers can **filter the calendar by employee**.

Managers and employees can **tag PTO from the main event creation page**, allowing them to easily keep track of employee availability.
