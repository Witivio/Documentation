## Can I choose to get notifications only for events I created or I am part of?

Currently, notifications are sent to all participants when enabled. Individual, per-user notification filtering is not available ‚Äî notifications are <b>team-wide üë• </b>.

## Where do notifications appear in Teams?

üîîNotifications appear in your <b>Teams activity feed</b> (and optionally as a <b>Teams banner</b>, depending on your <b>Teams notification preferences</b>).

## Can I disable notifications just for myself?

No. Notifications are managed at the calendar level by the <b>tab owner</b>. If notifications are enabled, all participants will receive them.
