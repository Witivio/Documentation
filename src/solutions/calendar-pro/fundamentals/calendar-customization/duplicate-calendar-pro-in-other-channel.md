## Will new events added after duplication also appear in the copied calendar?

<p class="no-margin">No. Duplication is a <b>one-time import</b>. Events created after the duplication will not be synced automatically. If you want the new events to appear, you’ll need to repeat the duplication process.</p>

## Can I duplicate the same calendar into multiple channels?

<p class="no-margin">Yes. You can create <b>several duplicates</b> in different channels. Each duplicate is <b>independent</b>, and updates in one do not affect the others.</p>

## Does duplicating a calendar also copy permissions and settings?

<p class="no-margin">No. <b>Only the events are copied.</b> Permissions, tags, and calendar settings must be configured again in the duplicated calendar.</p>

## What happens if I delete events in the original calendar? Will they disappear in the duplicate?

<p class="no-margin">No. Once duplicated, the calendars are <b>independent</b>. Deleted events in the original <b>will not affect the duplicate.</b></p>
