## Do public holidays apply to all participants in the calendar?

Yes. Once configured, public holidays are <b>displayed for everyone</b> using that calendar.

## Can I add custom holidays that are not in the predefined list?

Currently, <b>only the predefined country/region holiday sets</b> are available. To mark additional days (e.g., company holidays), you can create an all-day event manually.

## If I change the country, will it remove my previously selected holidays?

Yes. Switching the country updates the holiday set to match the new selection, <b>replacing the old one</b>.

## Can I display multiple countries‚Äô public holidays at the same time?

No. Only one country/region üåç holiday set can be active at a time in a calendar. If your team spans several countries, you can either:

2. <b>Duplicate the calendar</b> for each region. 

## Do public holidays automatically update each year?

Yes. Public holiday lists are maintained and <b>automatically refresh every year üîÑ.</b> No manual update is needed.
