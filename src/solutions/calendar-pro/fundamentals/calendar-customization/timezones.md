# Changing the time zone in Calendar Pro

## General calendar view

To change the time zone for the entire calendar:

1. **Navigate to the time zone dropdown:**
   - At the top of the calendar interface, locate the time zone dropdown menu. This is typically found in the upper part of the screen, as shown in the image below.

<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/image_104.png"></div>

2. **Select the desired time zone:**
   - Click on the dropdown menu to reveal a list of available time zones.
   - Scroll through the list or use the search bar to find your desired time zone.
   - Click on the preferred time zone by scrolling or typing based on continent/region (e.g., `America/New_York`).

::Tip:: use _ in case the region has more than one word and has a spacing inbetween. For certain regions, you can also find a more specified timezone by adding a second '/' (e.g., `America/Indiana/Indianapolis`)

3. **Confirm the change:**
   - Once selected, the calendar will automatically update to reflect the new time zone. You will also see the automatically updated national public holiday respective to the updated region of the time zone.
