## Does changing the calendar time zone affect all participants?

✅ Yes. Updating the calendar’s time zone applies to <b>everyone in that channel</b>, and events/holidays adjust automatically.

## What happens to existing events if I change the calendar time zone?

🔄 Events are <b>shifted to the new time zone.</b> For example, an event set at 10:00 AM will now display at the equivalent time in the new zone.

## Can multiple time zones be displayed at once?

🌍 No. Only <b>one active time zone</b> can be shown in the calendar view. However, individual events can each be set to a different zone if needed.

## Will public holidays update when I change the time zone?

🎉 Yes. The list of public holidays is refreshed automatically to match the region linked to the new time zone.

## How should I manage a team working across different time zones?

Best practice is to keep the <b>calendar on the main team’s time zone</b>, and for specific cross-regional meetings, use the <b>event-level time zone option.</b> 👥 This keeps scheduling clear for all participants.
