  <!-- Troubleshooting & Support -->
  ## Troubleshooting & Support 🧰

  ### My app/tab isn’t opening in Teams (title shows but can’t open / missing on mobile).
  <p>This usually stems from <strong>tenant policies</strong>. Ask IT to check:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App registration disabled</li>
    <li>Enterprise Application disabled</li>
    <li>New/changed <em>Conditional Access</em> policy</li>
    <li>Admin consent revoked</li>
    <li>A tenant-wide setting disabled</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>(Our services are hosted in <strong>EU (Ireland)</strong> on Microsoft Azure.)</em></p>

  ### Calendar Pro isn’t working. What should I send to support to speed things up?
  In the chat of <a href="https://admin.teams-pro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Teams-Pro Admin Center</strong></a>. Please include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your plan (Free/Premium/Platinum)</li>
    <li>Your role (IT admin, user, educator, HR, etc.)</li>
    <li>Detailed description of the issue</li>
    <li>When it started (date/time or after a change)</li>
    <li>Whether you are a tab owner; include Tenant ID and Channel name if possible</li>
    <li>Screenshot or recording of the issue</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This lets us investigate immediately.</p>

  ### We changed tenants (Microsoft 365 migration). Can we move existing calendars?
  <p>Two options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Recreate manually in the new tenant (no fee).</li>
    <li>Paid migration service handled by our team (quote depends on how many calendars). Tell us the count of calendars to receive a quote.</li>
  </ul>
