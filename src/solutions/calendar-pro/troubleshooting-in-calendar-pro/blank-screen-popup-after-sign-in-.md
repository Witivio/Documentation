# Blank screen popup after sign in

<p class="no-margin">When you sign in Calendar Pro and you have a blank pop-up.</p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/7_1.png"></div>
 <p class="no-margin"></p>
  <p class="no-margin">The workaround is to popup the tab and to login.</p>
<p class="no-margin">In case the issue persists despite the log in and appears with a blank screen, then kindly log in to Teams through the web browser and give consent to the application through the small pop-up window.</p>
 <p class="no-margin">Once done, you can have access with ease in the Teams application as well.</p>
