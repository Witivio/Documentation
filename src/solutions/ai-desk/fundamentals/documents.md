|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initializing          | The indexing process is starting. The system is preparing the document for further processing.    |
| Reading file          | The system is reading the raw content of the file to extract necessary data.                      |
| Parsing               | The system is analyzing the document's structure (e.g., extracting text, detecting sections).     |
| Using OCR             | The system is using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from image-based files. If included in your subscription.  |
| Not supported         | The document's file type or format is not supported by the system.                                |
| Unreadable            | The document cannot be read due to corruption, inaccessible permissions, or unsupported encoding. |
| Ignored               | The document was intentionally skipped based on system rules (e.g., too many pages, subscription limits reached).         |
| Creating Embedding    | The system is generating vector embeddings of the document for intelligent search and linkage.    |
| Updating              | The system is updating the document's index to reflect recent changes in content or metadata.     |
| Completed             | The indexing process is finished. The document is ready for use in the system.                   |

- Ensure that the permissions are set correctly on the SharePoint site to allow the appropriate users access to the documents.

### Best Practices
- Regularly add and review SharePoint libraries.
- Remove outdated libraries to maintain AI Desk's performance.

### Document Indexation and Metadata Management

When indexing documentation, specific criteria and filters are applied to ensure the most relevant document is retrieved when a user submits a query. The process for managing metadata and determining which document is selected involves the following:

#### 1. **Pre-filters for Version Control**
   To ensure that versioning is correctly accounted for, the system applies various filters based on:
   - **File Names**: The document's name is checked for version-specific details.
   - **Directory Names**: The folder structure is examined for version indications.
   - **Contract Addendums and Contract Numbers**: Relevant metadata related to contracts is analyzed.
   - **Status Indicators (e.g., Old, Draft, Published)**: Documents are filtered based on their status to prioritize relevant versions.

#### 2. **Primary Criterion (P1): Version Number Priority**
   - The version number is the leading criterion for document selection. The system prioritizes documents that have clear versioning information embedded in their metadata or file names.

#### 3. **Secondary Criterion (P2): Update Date**
   - If no explicit version number is found, the system defaults to using the **latest update date** to determine the most current and relevant document.

This structured approach ensures that users receive the most appropriate document based on versioning and recency when querying the system.
