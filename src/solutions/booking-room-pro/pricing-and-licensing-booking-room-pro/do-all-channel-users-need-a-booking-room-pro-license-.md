# Do all channel users need a Booking Room Pro license?

<p class="no-margin">You should purchase a license for each team member who wants to use the Premium features.  </p>
<p class="no-margin">For example, for Booking Room Pro, those team members who do not have a license allocated will only see up to 3 rooms, will only be able to create single reservations, won't be able to use tags or geolocation.  </p>
<p class="no-margin"></p>
<p class="no-margin">Premium users will have access to all premium features.  </p>
