## Why Can't a Transfer Be Initiated?

#### For Super Admin

###### Your Account Has Credits

If your account has credits, you must use them before initiating a role transfer. You will need to wait until your account has no remaining credits. You can use these credits by upgrading your current subscription to add more licenses or simply wait until the next billing date.

:::tip
Credits are always applied before charging your credit card.
