## Why can't a transfer be initiated?

#### For super admin

###### Your account has credits

If your account has credits, you must use them before initiating a role transfer. You will need to wait until your account has no remaining credits. You can use these credits by upgrading your current subscription to add more licenses or simply wait until the next billing date.

:::tip
Credits are always applied before charging your credit card.

###### Your account has unbilled charges

To resolve unbilled charges, please follow these steps:

- Ensure that the bank account linked to your payment method has sufficient funds.
- Verify that your payment method is still valid.
- Check that no transactions from our service are being blocked by your bank.

#### For admins

Thereâ€™s no action required on your part. This issue must be resolved by your Super Admin. Feel free to share this documentation page with them so they can take the necessary steps.
