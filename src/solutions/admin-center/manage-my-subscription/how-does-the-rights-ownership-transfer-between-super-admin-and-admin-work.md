## How does the rights ownership transfer between Super Admin and Admin work?

 <h3>Step 1: Initiation by Super Admin üîê</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>Super Admin</strong> logs into the Admin Center.</li>
    <li>They select the <strong>Admin</strong> to whom they wish to transfer Super Admin rights.</li>
    <li>The Super Admin <strong>confirms the transfer</strong>, initiating the process.</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

  <h3>Step 2: Confirmation email to Super Admin ‚úâÔ∏è</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Once initiated, the Super Admin receives a <strong>confirmation email</strong> stating the process has started.</li>
    <li>The email explains the transfer completes after the Admin <strong>accepts the role</strong> and <strong>updates payment information</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 3: Notification email to Admin</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Admin receives a <strong>notification email</strong> about the rights transfer.</li>
    <li>The email includes instructions to <strong>update billing details</strong> in the Admin Center.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 4: Admin updates information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The Admin logs into the Admin Center.</li>
    <li>A <strong>pop-up dialog</strong> prompts updating the <strong>payment method</strong> and <strong>billing &amp; shipping address</strong> to complete the transfer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 5: Confirmation email to Admin ‚úÖ</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>After the Admin saves the required updates, they receive a <strong>confirmation email</strong>.</li>
    <li>This confirms the transfer is finalized and they are now the <strong>Super Admin</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 6: Final notification email to former Super Admin</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The former Super Admin receives an email confirming the successful transfer.</li>
    <li>The message reminds them their role has changed to <strong>Admin</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Step 7: Reminder for non-compliance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If the Admin does not update billing information, a <strong>reminder email</strong> is sent to prompt completion.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>This process ensures a clear and documented transition of Super Admin rights, maintaining accountability and continuity.</em></p>
