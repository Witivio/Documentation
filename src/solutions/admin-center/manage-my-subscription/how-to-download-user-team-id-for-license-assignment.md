## How to download the User Team ID for license assignment

To streamline the process of assigning licenses, especially if your organization has over 50 users, we recommend downloading a .csv file from the Microsoft Teams Admin Center. This file contains each user's Team ID, which we use to automate license assignments and save time on manual input.

### Step-by-Step guide

1. **Access the Teams Admin Center**  
   Go to the [Microsoft Teams Admin Center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/users). Note that only Teams administrators have access to this page.

2. **Locate the users section**  
   In the Admin Center, navigate to the "Users" tab. This section displays a list of all users within your Teams environment.

3. **Filter the user list (optional)**  
   If you only need the Team IDs for specific users, you can use the **Filter** option located next to the Excel button. Apply the necessary filters to refine the user list before downloading.

4. **Download user data**  
   Once your filters are applied (if any), click the **Excel button** next to the search bar to download a .csv file containing the user data.

5. **Find the user Team ID in the .csv File**  
   Open the downloaded .csv file in a spreadsheet application. In this file, youâ€™ll find the **User Team ID** column, which lists each user's unique identifier. This ID is crucial for automating the license assignment.

### Why use the user Team ID?

The user Team ID allows us to automatically assign licenses, which is particularly helpful for organizations with a high volume of users. Without this ID, manually assigning licenses can become time-consuming and prone to error.
