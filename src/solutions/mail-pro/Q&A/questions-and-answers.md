# Q&A 

### Is activation always required?
Yes. Mail Pro cannot function until the admin completes the one-time activation (admin consent).

### Why do I see “Mail Pro is almost ready”?
Because admin consent has not yet been performed.

###What should I do?
Send the activation link from the card to your admin.

### Who should receive the link?
CEO, CTO, IT Manager, Office Manager, or Microsoft 365 administrator — depending on who manages apps.

### How long does activation take?
Around 20 seconds.

### Do I need to reinstall Mail Pro afterward?
No. It works immediately once activated.

### Does Mail Pro read every user’s emails?
No. It only reads your own mailbox and only when you use it.

### Can Mail Pro send emails?
No. It is strictly read-only.
