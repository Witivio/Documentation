# Mail Pro - Get Started Guide 

Mail Pro is an AI-powered email assistant available directly inside Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft Teams.
It helps employees search, summarize, and understand their inbox through natural, intelligent conversations — without leaving their workspace.
Mail Pro works in read-only mode and only accesses the user’s own mailbox. It never sends, deletes, or modifies emails.
Mail Pro requires a one-time activation performed by your organization (admin consent). Once approved, it becomes fully functional for all users.

## Installation & Access (via Microsoft Teams or Copilot)

Mail Pro is available inside both **Microsoft Copilot** and **Microsoft Teams**.
Because Mail Pro reads emails, it requires a mandatory admin approval before it can operate. Until this step is completed, users will see a message indicating that activation is required.

How to access Mail Pro
1. Open Microsoft Copilot
2. Go to Copilot Agents
3. Select Mail Pro
4. Start asking your questions
Or via Microsoft Teams:
1. Open Microsoft Teams
2. Go to Apps
3. Search for Mail Pro
4. Open the application with copilot
If Mail Pro does not appear, your administrator may need to enable it in the Teams Admin Center.

## Activation Requirement (Admin Consent)

Mail Pro always requires a **one-time activation** from your organization.

This is a standard Microsoft requirement before Mail Pro can read your emails.
If activation has not been completed, you will see this message:
**Mail Pro is almost ready. One quick activation and your inbox is live.**
This simply means:
- Mail Pro is installed
- Your organization has not yet approved access to your emails
- Admin consent is required for Mail Pro to work

Admin consent allows Mail Pro to use Microsoft Graph in read-only mode.

##### What you need to do as a user

You do not configure anything yourself.
Your single step is:
1. Click the activation link shown in the Mail Pro card : <a href="https://www.teams-pro.com/en/mail-pro/consent" traget="_blank" rel="noopener">Mail Pro</a>
2. Send that link to the person who manages Microsoft apps in your company
This is usually the CEO (small companies), CTO, IT Manager, Office Manager, or Microsoft 365 admin.
Once you send the link, **your part is done**.

##### What your admin does
When your admin clicks the activation link, they follow a very quick process:
1. The activation page opens
2. They read a short explanation
3. They confirm activation
This approval enables Mail Pro to read your mailbox in read-only mode.
The process takes **about 20 seconds** and requires no setup.
After this confirmation, Mail Pro is active for your organization.

##### After activation
Once activated:
- The activation banner disappears
- Mail Pro starts returning complete answers
- All features become available immediately
If you still see the activation message, your admin may not have completed the approval.
