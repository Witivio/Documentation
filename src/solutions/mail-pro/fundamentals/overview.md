# Fundamentals 

Mail Pro is built around natural-language interactions.
Instead of manually sorting or searching through your inbox, you simply ask questions, and Mail Pro classifies, summarizes, and extracts information directly from your emails.
Mail Pro provides built-in suggestions to help you explore your inbox and supports freeform prompting for deeper analysis and prioritization.
