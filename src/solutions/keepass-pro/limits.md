### KeePass Pro Limitations with Private Channels in Microsoft Teams

KeePass Pro cannot be added to a private channel in Microsoft Teams due to the limitations of SharePoint integration in private channels. The KeePass Pro application stores its KDBX vault file in SharePoint, but private channels do not have full access to SharePoint resources, meaning the necessary permissions to access the vault are restricted.

As a result, KeePass Pro cannot function correctly within private channels. For full functionality, we recommend using KeePass Pro in standard channels, which have full SharePoint integration.
