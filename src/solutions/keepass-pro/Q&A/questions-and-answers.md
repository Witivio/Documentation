  <!-- Features & Usage -->
  ## Features & Usage 🔐

  ### Can I use an existing KeePass database?
  <p><strong>Yes.</strong> You can <strong>connect or import</strong> an existing <strong>.kdbx</strong> vault so teams can keep using their current database inside Microsoft Teams. 📥</p>

  ### How does sharing/permissions work?
  <p>Create a vault as a <strong>Teams tab</strong> for shared use or <strong>pin a personal vault</strong>. Use KeePass Pro’s <strong>roles/permissions</strong> to grant <strong>view / edit / manage</strong> rights at vault, folder, or entry level (according to plan). Only <strong>authorized users</strong> can open the vault in Teams. 👥</p>

  ### Can we have multiple vault owners?
  <p><strong>Yes.</strong> <strong>Multiple owners</strong> are supported (available on higher plans), so you can delegate administration and avoid single-owner bottlenecks. 👑</p>

  ### Does it work in private or shared channels?
  <p>Install the tab in the channel where the team will use the vault. Availability depends on where the vault file can live in <strong>SharePoint</strong>; follow your organization’s <strong>channel/storage rules</strong>. 📁</p>


  <!-- Data, Storage & Compliance -->
  ## Data, Storage & Compliance 🛡️

  ### Where is the vault stored? Who owns the data?
  <p>In your <strong>Microsoft 365 tenant</strong>, the KeePass <strong>.kdbx</strong> file is saved in your <strong>SharePoint/OneDrive</strong> (the team’s site if it’s a channel tab, or your OneDrive if it’s personal). <strong>Your organization</strong> retains control of access and storage. 🔐</p>

  ### What encryption does KeePass Pro use?
  <p>Vaults use the KeePass <strong>.kdbx</strong> format with <strong>AES-256 encryption</strong> and are protected by a <strong>master password</strong> that your organization controls. 🛡️</p>

  ### Can Teams-Pro/Witivio see our passwords?
  <p><strong>No.</strong> The <strong>master password is not shared</strong> with the vendor. Access to entries is governed by the <strong>permissions you set</strong> and your tenant’s identity controls. 🚫</p>

  ### Can I restore an older version of the vault?
  <p>If your <strong>SharePoint library has versioning enabled</strong>, you can <strong>restore a previous version</strong> of the <strong>.kdbx</strong> file from <strong>SharePoint’s version history</strong>. ⏪</p>

  ### Where can I read about data security &amp; privacy?
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Teams-Pro Trust Center:</strong> <a href="https://trust.teams-pro.com/trust/center/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://trust.teams-pro.com/trust/center/overview/</a></li>
    <li><strong>Witivio Trust Center (restricted):</strong> <a href="https://trust.witivio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://trust.witivio.com/</a> (request access with your use case)</li>
  </ul>


  <!-- Access & External Collaboration -->
  ## Access & External Collaboration 🌐

  ### Do guests/external users work?
  <p>They can, if you grant them <strong>access in Teams</strong> <em>and</em> to the <strong>SharePoint</strong> location that stores the vault. Access mirrors your tenant’s <strong>external-sharing policies</strong>. 🌐</p>


  <!-- Troubleshooting & Support -->
  ## Troubleshooting & Support 🧰

  ### My app/tab isn’t opening in Teams (title shows but can’t open / missing on mobile).
  <p>This usually stems from <strong>tenant policies</strong>. Ask IT to check:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>App registration disabled</li>
    <li>Enterprise Application disabled</li>
    <li>New/changed <em>Conditional Access</em> policy</li>
    <li>Admin consent revoked</li>
    <li>A tenant-wide setting disabled</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>(Our services are hosted in <strong>EU (Ireland)</strong> on Microsoft Azure.)</em></p>

  ### What happens if someone leaves the company?
  <p>An <strong>owner</strong> can remove or reassign their access in <strong>KeePass Pro</strong> and in <strong>SharePoint/Teams</strong>. Because the vault lives in your tenant, <strong>you remain in control</strong>. 👤➡️🔒</p>
