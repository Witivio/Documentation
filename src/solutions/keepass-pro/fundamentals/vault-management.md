# Vault Management

## What is a Vault?

A vault in KeePass Pro is a secure digital container where you <b>store your passwords and sensitive information</b>. Each vault is protected by a <b>master password</b> and encrypted with <b>AES-256</b> for maximum security.
## Create a New Vault

You can create a new vault by <b>adding KeePass Pro as a tab</b> to a new <b>channel or team</b>. Simply follow the same process as setting up a KeePass Pro tab.

## Keep a Vault Private

To keep a vault private, <b>pin it to your Teams navigation bar</b> instead of adding it as a shared tab. This way, <b>only you can access it</b>.

## Import a KDBX File

You can import an existing <b>KeePass database (.kdbx file)</b> into KeePass Pro by following these steps:

1. <b>Add a KeePass vault</b> on a channel.
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/keepass-pro/section-keepass_import-vault.png"></div><p class="no-margin"></p>

2. Click on the <b>vault location name</b> (highlighted in purple, e.g., “sales”). A new tab will open with the linked SharePoint folder.

3. <b>Upload your .kdbx file</b> into this folder.
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/keepass-pro/section-keepass_import-vault1.png"></div><p class="no-margin"></p>
4. Return to KeePass Pro and select “<b>Clone existing vault</b>” from the configuration options.
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/keepass-pro/section-keepass_import-vault2.png"></div><p class="no-margin"></p>
5. If the file does not appear, click the <b>refresh icon</b> in the top-right corner. Select your uploaded file once it appears.

6. Enter the <b>master password</b> for the database and click “<b>Save</b>”.
<div class="intercom-container"><img src="/assets/img/teams-pro/keepass-pro/section-keepass_import-vault3.png"></div><p class="no-margin"></p>
All passwords stored in the selected database will be imported into KeePass Pro.

⚠️ <b>Important:</b>

* Only databases stored in the <b>SharePoint folder of the same Teams channel</b> where KeePass Pro is installed can be cloned.

* Make sure the original database is <b>encrypted using AES encryption.</b>
