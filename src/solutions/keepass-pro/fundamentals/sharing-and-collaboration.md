To share a password, simply <b>click on the share icon</b> located at the bottom right of the card. A new window will appear with the link to the password. By sharing this link with anyone who's a member of the channel, <b>you will share the password location</b>.

Alternatively, click on the specific password you wish to share, which will open its details. <b>From the top right, you can then share the password</b> by copying the link of the desired password from the pop-up window.

⚠️ Please note that <b>you can share passwords only when you have added KeePass Pro to a tab (shared channel)</b>. This function is not available for private vaults or private channels.

KeePass Pro displays <b>all shared vaults</b> you have access to <b>within the app interface</b>. These are visible under the “Shared Vaults” section in the main dashboard. <b>You do not need to configure anything</b> – vaults shared with your team or workspace appear automatically.

## Global Permissions

Global permissions allow you to set <b>default access levels for all members</b> in a shared vault. This is useful for larger teams where you want to quickly assign the same access level to multiple users.

## Custom Permissions

Custom permissions provide more <b>granular control over who can view, edit, or delete</b> passwords or folders within a vault. This is ideal for sensitive data that only certain team members should access.

## Folder-level Permissions

Folder-level permissions allow you to <b>control who can access specific folders within a vault</b>. Users added to a folder can view the contents of that folder, but their ability to edit or delete items depends on the specific permissions you grant them. This is <b>useful for organizing passwords by project, department, or sensitivity level</b>.
