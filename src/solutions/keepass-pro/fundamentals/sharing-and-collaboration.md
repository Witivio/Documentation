  <b>Option 1 (from the card):</b> Click the <strong>Share</strong> icon at the bottom-right of the password card.
  A window opens with a <strong>shareable link</strong> to the password location. Copy this link and share it with members of the same channel.

  <b>Option 2 (from details):</b> Click the specific <strong>password entry</strong> to open its details. In the
      top-right, choose <strong>Share</strong> and copy the link from the pop-up window.

  </ol>
  <p><strong>⚠️ Note:</strong> Sharing is available only when KeePass Pro is added as a <strong>tab in a shared channel</strong>.
    This feature is <em>not</em> available for <strong>private vaults</strong> or <strong>private channels</strong>.</p>

## Access shared Vaults
### How can I access shared vaults?

KeePass Pro displays <b>all shared vaults</b> you have access to <b>within the app interface</b>. These are visible under the “Shared Vaults” section in the main dashboard. <b>You do not need to configure anything</b> – vaults shared with your team or workspace appear automatically.

## Global Permissions

Global permissions allow you to set <b>default access levels for all members</b> in a shared vault. This is useful for larger teams where you want to quickly assign the same access level to multiple users.

## Custom Permissions

Custom permissions provide more <b>granular control over who can view, edit, or delete</b> passwords or folders within a vault. This is ideal for sensitive data that only certain team members should access.

## Folder-level Permissions

Folder-level permissions allow you to <b>control who can access specific folders within a vault</b>. Users added to a folder can view the contents of that folder, but their ability to edit or delete items depends on the specific permissions you grant them. This is <b>useful for organizing passwords by project, department, or sensitivity level</b>.
