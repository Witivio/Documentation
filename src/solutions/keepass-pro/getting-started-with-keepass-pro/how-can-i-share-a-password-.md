# How can I share a password?

<p class="no-margin">To share a password, simply click on the share icon located at the bottom right of the card. A new window will appear with the link to the password. By sharing this link with anyone who's a member of the channel, you will share the password location.</p>

From the top right, you can then share the password by copying the link of the desired password from the pop-up window.</p>
