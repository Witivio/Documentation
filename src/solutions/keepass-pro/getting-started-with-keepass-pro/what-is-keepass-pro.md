## Personal or Shared Password Management

## How Safe Are My Passwords?
Your passwords are securely stored in a vault on your SharePoint, protected with AES-256 encryption and a master password. This means only the people you choose to share your vault with can access it, not even the KeePass Pro team has access to your data. This level of security ensures that your sensitive information remains private and protected at all times.
