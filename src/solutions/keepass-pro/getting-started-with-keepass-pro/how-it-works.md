# How it works
KeePass Pro is built around the concept of <b>vaults, tabs, and permissions</b>, providing a flexible and secure way to manage your passwords.

## Vaults

Vaults are secure digital containers for your passwords. Each vault is protected by a<b> master password</b> and encrypted using<b> AES-256</b>, the industry standard for secure data storage. Vaults can be private (accessible only to the owner) or shared (accessible to multiple users). You can create<b> as many vaults as needed</b> to organize your passwords based on projects, departments, or clients.

### Personal vs Shared Vaults

* <b>Personal Vaults</b> - Use these for your private passwords. These are not accessible to anyone else and can be <b>pinned to your Teams navigation bar</b>. Ideal for storing sensitive credentials like admin logins or confidential client information.

* <b>Shared Vaults</b> - These are added as <b>tabs in your Teams channels</b>, allowing you to share credentials securely with your colleagues. Perfect for collaborative work where multiple team members need access to shared resources like <b>server logins, Wi-Fi passwords, or API keys.</b>

### Key Vault Features:

* <b>Unlimited Password Storage</b> (depending on plan)

* <b>AES-256 Encryption</b> for maximum security

* <b>Master Password Protection</b> to prevent unauthorized access

* <b>Organized Folders</b> (Platinum only) for better password management

## Tabs

Tabs in KeePass Pro are used to organize your vaults<b> within Microsoft Teams</b>. Each tab corresponds to a specific vault, making it easy to <b>switch between different sets of passwords</b>. Adding KeePass Pro as a tab in a channel makes it accessible to all members of that channel.

### How to Use Tabs Effectively:

* <b>Project-Specific Tabs</b> - Use separate tabs for different projects or departments to avoid mixing credentials.

* <b>Client-Specific Tabs </b>- Create tabs for each client to securely store and share passwords relevant to that client.

* <b>Shared vs Personal Tabs</b> - Shared tabs can be accessed by all members of a channel, while personal vaults can be pinned to your Teams navigation bar for private access.

## Permissions

Permissions allow you to control who can <b>view, edit, and manage passwords</b> within each vault. KeePass Pro provides multiple levels of permission to ensure that <b>only authorized users have access to sensitive information</b>:

### Global Permissions

Apply to all users within a shared channel. Useful for setting up default access for large teams.

### Custom Permissions

Set <b>individual access levels</b> for each user, such as view-only, edit, delete, or full control. This is essential for controlling who can modify or delete sensitive credentials.

### Folder/Password-Level Permissions

Manage access at the <b>folder level for more granular control</b>. For example, you might restrict access to HR-related credentials to only the HR team.

### Key Permission Settings:

* <b>Add Passwords</b> - Allow users to add new entries.

* <b>Modify Passwords</b> - Allow users to update existing passwords.

* <b>Delete Passwords</b> - Allow users to permanently remove entries.

* <b>Owner Rights</b> - Transfer ownership of a vault to another team member (Platinum only).

With these features, KeePass Pro offers a <b>complete, secure, and flexible password management solution</b> tailored for teams of all sizes.
