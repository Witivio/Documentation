# What is a KeePass Pro vault?

<p class="no-margin">A KeePass Pro vault is like a highly secure digital safe for all your different passwords. Just like a physical vault protects valuable items, the KeePass Pro vault safeguards your online passwords. <b>This vault is locked with a "master" key</b>, which could be a password or a special file, or both. <b>Once it's locked, the vault is then stored in SharePoint, a platform that provides additional layers of security and allows for easy access when you need to retrieve your passwords.</b></p>

<p class="no-margin">To better visualize it, imagine you have a big bunch of keys for different rooms. Now, instead of carrying all these keys with you, you keep them in a secure box. To open this box, you only need one main key. In this analogy, the box is your KeePass Pro vault, the room keys are your various online passwords, and the main key to open the box is your master password.</p>

<p class="no-margin">This system is helpful because you just need to remember your master key, and it takes care of the rest, giving you access to all your different passwords securely. Plus, it uses very advanced methods of encryption (just like complex, high-tech locking systems) to make sure your passwords are as safe as possible. The vault, with all of its secured passwords, is then safely stored on SharePoint.</p>
