## Feature Migration Guide 

This comprehensive table outlines the migration status and configuration requirements for each feature available in GPT Pro. It serves as a detailed resource for Virtual Agent Studio administrators to understand which features need manual intervention, which are ready to use, and which are not supported in GPT Pro. Each entry specifies the necessary action (Manual, Script, Use Company Communicator Pro, or N/A), along with any additional comments to guide you through the migration process efficiently.
