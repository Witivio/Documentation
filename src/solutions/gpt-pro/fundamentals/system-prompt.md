# System Prompt

## Overview

A system prompt is a predefined instruction given to the AI to shape its responses and guide its behavior. It provides context to ensure that the AI's output aligns with specific expectations or guidelines. Setting up an effective system prompt is essential for achieving accurate and relevant responses from the AI.

## Tips for Creating Effective System Prompts:
1. Clarity and Structure: Be as clear and specific as possible about the role and context the AI should take. Use steps or stages to break down complex interactions.

2. Personalization: Tailor responses based on the user's profile, context, or role. Customize the answer based on the scenario or topic they are asking about.

3. Consistency: Ensure that the AI follows a consistent approach for each case, especially when dealing with structured information like policies, troubleshooting guides, or product details.

4. Empathy and Tone: If the AI is interacting with users (e.g., employees or customers), guide it to maintain a professional yet approachable tone, ensuring clarity and helpfulness.

5. Feedback Loop: Add checks in the system prompt to ensure that the AI asks for clarification if the query is vague or incomplete.
