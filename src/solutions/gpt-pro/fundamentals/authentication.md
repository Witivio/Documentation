# Admin center authentication

At Witivio, protecting our customers' data is our top priority. To ensure a secure and seamless authentication experience, GPT-Pro leverages Office 365 Single Sign-On (SSO) for accessing our applications. This approach integrates directly with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), using incremental consent to request only the necessary permissions as users interact with our solution, minimizing access requests and protecting user privacy.

Through Office 365 SSO, GPT-Pro enables customers to:
- Enforce their own security policies for authentication, ensuring compliance with organizational standards.
- Leverage Office 365 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) where it‚Äôs configured or required, adding an extra layer of protection.
- Control user access to the application directly within their Azure AD environment, simplifying management for security teams.
- Comply with consent policies for permissions, ensuring transparent permission requests and adherence to established security protocols.

The sections that follow in this documentation will guide you through the incremental consent process, detailing how and when additional permissions are requested and how to manage them for optimal security and compliance.

::: warning
‚ö†Ô∏è Each step in this documentation **may vary depending on the security policies configured by your organization**. At any point, admin rights might be required, even if not explicitly indicated in the official [Microsoft Graph permissions documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference).
