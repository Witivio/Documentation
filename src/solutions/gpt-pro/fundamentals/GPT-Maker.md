:::tip
GPT Pro will help on your creation process to set-up your GPT so you can get the best outcome of your chatbot. While AI facilitate the GPT creation process, it is always a good idea to give more details to GPT Pro of the outcome you're looking to get from the GPT. With better specifications, the better the quality of your GPT will be.

## Managing GPTs
Once a GPT is set-up, you will see them in the GPT overview of your admin dashboard. Here's what you can do:

1. See an overview of your GPTs created
2. Consult the creation date for each GPT
3. Check the deployment status of each GPT, if they are fully deployed or still in the initializing process
4. Properly configure each GPT by clicking on the `actions` button then `details`, or simply click on the GPT name. You will be faced by a dashboard dedicated of your respective GPT, where you can configure and monitor different aspects of your GPT.
