## Multilingual capabilities
GPT Pro uses GPT-4o as model.

GPT-4o outperforms both previous large language models and as of 2023, most state-of-the-art systems (which often have benchmark-specific training or hand-engineering). On the MMLU benchmark, an English-language suite of multiple-choice questions covering 57 subjects, GPT-4o not only outperforms existing models by a considerable margin in English, but also demonstrates strong performance in other languages.
