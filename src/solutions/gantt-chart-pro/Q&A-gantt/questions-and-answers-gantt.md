  ## Pricing & Licensing 💳

  ### What’s the difference between Free and Premium?
  <p>Free includes essentials (dependencies, notes, progress, filter/sort) but is limited to <strong>5 tasks / 3 participants</strong> and a smaller project size. <strong>Premium</strong> adds <strong>unlimited tasks/subtasks/participants</strong>, task colors, milestones, and exports (CSV/XLSX/PDF).</p>

  ### Do all channel users need a license?
  <p>No. License only users who need <strong>Premium</strong> features. Unlicensed users can still access the tab within <strong>Free</strong> limits. 🔓</p>

 ### Where do I buy or manage licenses and invoices?
  <p>In the <a href="https://admin.teams-pro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teams-Pro Admin Center</a>.</p>

  ## Features & Usage 📊

  ### Which export formats are supported?

  ### Can I control who edits the plan?
  <p>Yes. Set <strong>owners only</strong> or <strong>everyone</strong> in the tab’s permissions. 🔐</p>

  ### Can I assign people to tasks?
  <p>Yes. Add <strong>participants</strong> 👥 to tasks so ownership is clear across the team.</p>
