  ## Common Questions

  ### What’s the difference between Free and Premium, in one line?
  Free covers core planning (<strong>tasks</strong>, <strong>dependencies</strong>, <strong>progress/notes</strong>). <strong>Premium</strong> removes size limits and adds <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>milestones</strong>, and <strong>exports (CSV/XLSX/PDF)</strong> for reporting and stakeholder sharing. 

  ### Do all channel users need Premium?
  No. License only the people who need <strong>Premium</strong> features; others can use the tab within the <strong>Free</strong> experience. 🔓

  ### Which export formats are supported in Premium?
  <strong>CSV</strong>, <strong>Excel (.xlsx)</strong>, and <strong>PDF</strong>. Use <strong>CSV/XLSX</strong> for data analysis, and <strong>PDF</strong> for a shareable snapshot. 📑

  ### Where do I compare plans and start a trial?
