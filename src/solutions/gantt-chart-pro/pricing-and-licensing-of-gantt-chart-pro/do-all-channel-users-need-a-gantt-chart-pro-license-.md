# Pricing & Licensing

## Do all channel users need a Gantt Chart Pro license?

No. Purchase a license for each user who needs <b>Premium</b> features. Users <b>without</b> a license can still access the tab but are <b>limited to up to 5 tasks, 3 participants, and a smaller project size</b>; Premium lifts these limits (unlimited tasks, participants, and more).

## What’s the difference between Free and Premium in Gantt Chart Pro?
Free (Basic) allows up to 5 tasks, 3 participants, and a limited project size. Premium provides unlimited tasks, unlimited subtasks, and unlimited participants, plus additional capabilities and scalability. Both include essentials like notes, progress tracking, and export options.

## Is there a free trial?
Yes. You can request a free trial from the Gantt Chart Pro page. 


## Where do I buy licenses or manage my subscription (seats, billing, invoices)?
Use the Teams-Pro Admin Center. The Gantt Pro site links to Manage licenses and Manage subscriptions (Admin Center) from its footer/resources. 


## What exactly does Premium add beyond removing limits?
The Compare plans section highlights unlimited tasks/subtasks/participants, task color, milestones, and exports to PDF/CSV/XLSX as part of the Premium feature set. Check the plan table on the product page for the most current list. 


## Which export formats are supported?
You can export to CSV, Excel (.xlsx), and PDF to share reports or archive timelines. (See Export & Reporting and the plan comparison.) 


## Can we mix Free and Premium users in the same channel?
Yes. Users without a license will be subject to the 5 tasks / 3 participants limit, while licensed users get Premium capabilities (unlimited, etc.). 


## Are there data/compliance differences by plan?
The plan comparison mentions EU data residency, GDPR compliance, and data retention/recovery details under Data Management—these policies are shown in the plan table and may vary by tier. Refer to the product page for the latest specifics.
