# Do all channel users need a Gantt Chart Pro license?

<p class="no-margin">You should purchase a license for each team member who wants to use the Premium features. For example, for Gantt Chart Pro, those team members who do not have a license allocated will only see up to 5 tasks, 3 participants, and limited project size. Premium version offers unlimited tasks, participants, and personalization.</p>
